## 4. Content Strategy

3.  **Organize:** Structure the information logically on each page. Use headings, bullet points, and bold text to make it scannable.
4.  **Visuals:** We can create simple, clean graphics or use royalty-free images to make the pages more visually appealing.

## 5. SEO & Monetization Strategy

*   **On-Page SEO:**
    *   Each page will have a unique, keyword-rich `<title>` (e.g., "R-CAT Cloud Computing Course | rcatrajasthan.com").
    *   Each page will have a compelling `<meta name="description">`.
    *   A `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` will be automatically generated by CodeIgniter to guide search engines.
*   **Content SEO:**
    *   The optional blog will be the primary driver for long-term organic traffic growth.
*   **Speed Optimization:**
    *   CodeIgniter's built-in caching system for faster page loads
    *   Optimized images and minified CSS/JS files
    *   Efficient database queries with proper indexing
*   **Monetization:**
    *   Once the site has high-quality content and steady traffic, we will apply for **Google AdSense**.
